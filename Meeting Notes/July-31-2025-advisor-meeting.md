Weekly Advisor Meeting Memo

**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Time:** 10:37 PM

**Advisor:** Dr. Marco Tacca

**Attendees:** Eric John Mutton, Adrianne E. Quick, Zack Alan Potersnak, Jairo Thiongo, Dominic Phu Nguyen

**Purpose:** Weekly status update and guidance for capstone project

# Team Updates
## 1. Procurement & Parts
- Parts ordering initiated; abstract submitted.
- Procurement form must be sent to Kevin in Excel format.
- Preliminary Bill of Materials created for prototyping phase, including multiple options for ICs and batteries.
## 2. Subsystem Progress
**Power/Battery Management:** Selected top candidates for fuel gauge and BMS ICs; prototype PCB planned for testing current, voltage, and power.

**Charger Safety:** Evaluating chargers for voltage stability, thermal performance, and EMI; device-side protection and MCU alerts planned.

**Microcontroller (ESP32 WROVER):** Using ESP-IDF for low power, timing, and communication; planning short educational YouTube videos.

**RF Subsystem:** Researching RF switches and circulators for transmit/receive isolation; will ensure impedance matching and study S-parameters.

**Audio Subsystem:** Digital amplifier (~1.6–3 W into 8Ω) selected for efficiency and compact design; I2S microphones will interface directly with MCU.

**HMI:** Display ordered; preliminary tests will start upon arrival; future work includes key matrix and GPIO expander.
## 3. Educational/Outreach Goals
• Plan to create an educational framework and supporting videos.

• Advisor suggested contacting local high school teachers for insights on outreach.

## Advisor Guidance
- Always use Excel for Kevin’s procurement approvals.
- Investigate circulators for RF isolation and ensure all signal paths are impedance matched. - Use RF Cafe and Microwaves101 as resources.
 
- Use lab environment for filming educational videos; phone cameras are sufficient. - Use DaVinci Resolve for free video editing.
- Expo poster can use the eLearning template; advisor will adjust final dimensions.
## Action Items
1. Resend procurement form to Kevin in Excel format.
2. Continue RF circulator research and ensure impedance matching. 3. Finalize poster template and Gantt chart.
4. Begin HMI testing and continue subsystem prototyping.
5. Develop educational/video plan and explore high school outreach.
