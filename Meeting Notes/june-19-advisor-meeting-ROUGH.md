Presented slides to Dr. Tacca

Qorvo is recommended for rf power specifications

Mentioned Qorvo eval board is $600 - Qorvo is rated for higher rf applications

DT is not sold on project

Wants to know advantage of two stage as opposed to one

Something we would need to evaluate 

Look into already in market solutions to our problem 

Need to figure out what is in the market

We are designing an evaluation board specific to HAMradio

Competing with the market (TI, Qorvo) is unlikely, advisor is skeptical

Focus on how we define cost - small scale vs large scale

figure out where we can compete 

are we doing this for profit or for amateurs

Can get certified in OpenSource if we are not competing in cost

Cost eval on third party assembly vs hand assembled

Attempt a single stage or justify the 2 stage approach 

HMI 

Communications interface - 

foster innovation among amateur radio users by not enclosing the amplification in a black box 

DT is confused on whether we are doing the amplifier or transceiver 

SDR - ADLM  & RTLSDR

Duplex operation - CC1200 

Microcontroller can be ESP32 but is prohibitive in application - figure out which is best MSP432 or another MC

can post in the TI forums for help or advise 

“walkie talkie” thats educational and customizable 

Things to look into:

HMI - what can the layman learn from our device without previous knowledge

what can we give the user beyond communication 

figure out learning experience vs ease of use for everyday user  

Post meeting meeting

Goal is PDR by July week one

Goal is CDR by August 8
