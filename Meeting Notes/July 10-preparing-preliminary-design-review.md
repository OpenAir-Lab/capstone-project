Meeting Overview
Team Meeting Summary - July 10, 2025
- Attendees: Zack Potersnak, Eric Mutton, Jairo Thiongo, Dominic
- Main Purpose: Align team on Preliminary Design Review (PDR) expectations, confirm access to
shared documentation, discuss technical progress, and identify blockers.
Key Points Discussed
Project Documentation & Structure
- Eric updated the design template to provide structure for each subsystem (microcontroller, power,
audio, RF).
- Adrianne originally created the template based on class examples.
- The goal is for everyone to contribute content before the Saturday meeting, which will be in person
if possible.
Subsystem Discussions and Blockers
RF Subsystem (Eric):
- Renamed from "amateur radio subsystem" to "RF subsystem".
- Major decision: choose between narrowband (efficient, complex) vs wideband (simpler, less
efficient).
- Leaning toward wideband for prototype.
- Blocker noted in GitHub issue #7.
Audio Subsystem (Dominic):
- No major blockers yet; more documentation needed.
- Mislabeling issue resolved (correct model: DFR0954).
- Plan to broaden research and update documentation.

Power/BMS Subsystem (Zack & Jairo):
- Discussed Battery Management System (BMS) and USB Power Delivery compatibility.
- Team prefers microcontroller-controlled charging current regulation.
- Fast charging preferred (3.5A), but final decision depends on system draw and battery specs.
PDR Presentation Planning
- PDR is a pass/fail assignment, repeatable until satisfactory.
- Tentative presentation date: July 17 (to confirm with Dr. Tacca).
- Presentation should include task descriptions and research findings, targeted at a
software-background professor.
- Expected duration: ~30 minutes.
Expo and Critical Design Review
- CDR expected 1-2 weeks before August 8 Expo.
- PDR serves as a draft for CDR.
- Expo requirements:
- One team member must attend in person.
- Submit poster and one-slide summary.
- Formal presentation occurs in front of judges/sponsors only.
Action Items
- All members to update documentation before Saturday.
- Zack to confirm July 17 PDR date with Dr. Tacca.
- Consider online format if Adrianne is unavailable in person.
